# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
~~The purpose of this project is to assist Louise in her crowd funding campaign to help fund her play, "Fever." She is estimating a budget of over $10,000, and by analyzing current crowdfunding data from around the world, this project aims to determine whether there are specific factors that make a campaign successful or unsuccessful.~~
## Results ~~Analysis and Challenges~~

### Results of Stock Performance between 2017 and 2018 ~~Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date~~
~~As shown below, we can see that the month of May tends to have the highest number of successful campaigns, as compared to December, where there is a significant drop. Louise would also do well to be wary of fundraising between September and October, as there is a drop in successful campaigns in the former and a rise in failures in the latter.~~
